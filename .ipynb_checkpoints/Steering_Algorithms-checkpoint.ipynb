    "In this notebook, I will explain how various steering algorithms were implemented in this research. First, I will provide an overview for an emulation of the EV3 MINDSTORMS steering algorithm, then I will introduce you to our current steering algorithm that keeps a constant average velocity on the robot at all times. I am including an analysis of benefits and liabilities for each.\n",
