# C2M2
A place for EV3 line-following code and controllers. 
## LEGO EV3
This repositiory will serve as a place to store the line-following algorithms that we use on our EV3 robots. The master contains stable releases of code that we write, while the individual branches are used for testing in the labspace.
Soon to come: python scripts, robot-build instructions, file for track.
